## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repository serves as a **hands-on learning resource** for mastering **LangGraph**, a graph-based framework built on top of LangChain for designing structured, multi-step AI workflows.

Each notebook and script illustrates a key concept â€” starting from the basics of **state graphs** and leading up to advanced **RAG-based agents** and a **Drafterâ€“Reviewer agent workflow**.

It complements the free course on freeCodeCamp: [Fundamentals of LangGraph](https://youtu.be/jGg_1h0qzaM?si=7qckrhSsxsvM9vbR)
